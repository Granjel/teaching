# Who am <span style="color:#4EBF7B">I</span>?

::: {.notes}
These are my notes.

## Life (1/2)

- born and raised in <span style="color:#4EBF7B">Vigo, Galicia</span>

- used to hide roly polies in pockets to take them home from kindergarten

- started hiding them in socks after teacher found out

- not super interested in the natural world growing up

- parents wanted me to be a medical doctor because of Franco^[I love my family, don't let my words fool you---they just wanted their son to be *somebody*]

- failed 8/9 last year of high school, had to retake it

:::

## Life (2/2)

- invoked the spirits of the roly polies and went to uni to become a <span style="color:#4EBF7B">biologist</span>

- adopted Meiga^[Who is a 🐈, not a roly poly]

- went on and became a real doctor

- met this woman who had a tank of pet roly polies, kidnapped her & married her

## How is biodiversity maintained?

:::{.incremental}

Imagine we have two species, 🌼 & 🪻:

a) If the <span style="color:#4EBF7B">niches</span> of 🌼 & 🪻 are totally different, they mind their own business ☮️

b) If their niches completely overlap, there's drama; <span style="color:#4EBF7B">competitive exclusion</span>^a^: the most competitive (🌼 = 🏅) outcompetes the least competitive (🪻 = 💀)

## Pairwise understanding of biodiversity maintenance (examples)

:::{.incremental}

- climate <span style="color:#4EBF7B">variability</span> has a stabilising effect in the community^d^, but climatic <span style="color:#4EBF7B">extremes</span> lead to lower probability of coexistence^e^

- the inferior competitor arriving first can generate <span style="color:#4EBF7B">close-to-neutrality</span> situations (low niche and fitness differences)^f^

- correlations between <span style="color:#4EBF7B">functional traits</span> and fitness differences are clear but not so much with niche differences^g^

- <span style="color:#4EBF7B">phylogeny</span> does not predict coexistence mechanisms, against expectations^h,i^

- etc.

## Come to me if you want (1/2)

- **to learn (or improve your) <span style="color:#4EBF7B">R skills</span>**
  - can help you better than chatGPT^[But worse than Mark]

- **an <span style="color:#4EBF7B">opinion</span> on dataviz (or anything else)**
  - can't see red on black very well, so please, don't highlight text in <span style="color:red">red</span>^[<span style="color:red">This background is not black so I'm ok-ish</span>] 🙏

- **to discuss an <span style="color:#4EBF7B">idea</span> you've had, ecologically relevant or not**
  - love talking science

- **to write a piece for [*The Conversation*](https://theconversation.com/es)**
  - would be happy to help shape the focus and co-author it with you

## Come to me if you want (2/2)

- **some <span style="color:#4EBF7B">mentoring</span> about how to navigate the academic system**
  - have experience in multiple situations so I *might* be helpful

- **to speak in Spanish, <span style="color:#4EBF7B">Galician</span>, or Portuguese**
  - for other languages beyond English, I'll delegate to my teammates

- **to play <span style="color:#4EBF7B">pádel</span>**
  - a bunch of people from BC3 go ~once a week

- **a favour or just a <span style="color:#4EBF7B">chat</span>**
  - this job is very demanding of our time and energy so let's prevent burnout
